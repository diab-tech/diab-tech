-ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Shabaan Diab


As a Frontend Engineer, Iâ€™m driven by a passion for clean, scalable code and modern web technologies. I stay on the bleeding edge of the tech sceneâ€”constantly learning, experimenting, and refining my skills.

I have a strong foundation in data structures, algorithms, object-oriented programming, and design patterns, which I apply to build maintainable and efficient solutions. My main stack includes JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Redux, and I also work comfortably with Next.js, GraphQL, Sass, and Tailwind CSS.

I care about qualityâ€”my workflow includes unit and integration testing, and Iâ€™m experienced with tools like Jest and React Testing Library. Iâ€™ve also worked with Docker, AWS, Git, and GitHub, and I'm always eager to go deeper.

I thrive in collaborative, fast-paced teams, but Iâ€™m just as effective working independently and taking ownership. Whether it's planning in Jira, tracking in Trello, or organizing in Asana, I communicate clearly and keep projects moving forward.

Iâ€™m also active in the tech communityâ€”contributing to open-source projects and staying connected with other developers. One of my key strengths? I learn fast and adapt even faster.

If youâ€™re looking for a developer who delivers clean code, cares about design, and moves with the timesâ€”letâ€™s build something great together.
